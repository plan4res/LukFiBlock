# LukFiBlock

Implementation of the Block and C05Function classes for some non-smooth functions.
The block contains a FRealObjective whose the function is a C05Function type.

## Getting started

These instructions will let you build LukFiBlock on your system.

### Requirements

- [SMS++ core library](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp)

### Build and install with CMake

Configure and build the library with:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The library has the same configuration options of
[SMS++](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project/-/wikis/Customize-the-configuration).

Optionally, install the library in the system with:

```sh
sudo make install
```

### Usage with CMake

```cmake
find_package(LukFiBlock)
target_link_libraries(<my_target> SMS++::LukFiBlock)
```
